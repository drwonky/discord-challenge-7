One Lone Coder Discord Programming Challenge #7 -- guess a 4 digit code in minimum tries/memory

Difficulty: Beginner -> Advanced!

Code Battle! Create a routine that cracks a code in as few guesses as possible!
A hidden code, eg "ABCD" is to be cracked by guessing and learning. You will
code the body of a function and return a guess eg "AACD". You will then be told
how well you did for your next guess! Isn't that nice! Specifically, how many
digits are fully correct (ie correct digit in correct position) and how many
are partially correct (ie correct digit in incorrect position).

If any submissions are made, I will write code that shows them all competing
at the same time to crack the same codes! Lowest average score over 1000 
randomly generated codes will be declared winner!

Bonus points for algorithms which require the least amount of memory!

Rules:
1) Must compile and run in ideone. (www.ideone.com)
2) You must only use memory in the buffer provided, you can allocate more in 
    your function, but it must be cleaned up before your function exits.
3) A maximum of 100 guesses has been set
4) You can only edit the codebreak() function body, and gMemoryRequired 
    constant value (1 -> 16384)
5) Entries not in the spirit of the competition will be disqualified
6) No additional libraries can be included
7) In the event that the framework is insufficient, this code may be 
    modified by the organiser (@javidx9)
8) Memory hacks, or attempts to circumvent the framework are allowed
    because they are interesting, but will not be considered for
    competition
